2. A magic 8 ball game. You ask yes or no questions and it gives you an answer.

3.responselist, again, infile, question

4. main

5. The 'main' function executes the magic 8 ball game. It starts off with 'infile' reading the 8ball_responses,txt
The 'responselist' puts the 8ball_responses into list form. From there 'again' is created as string 'y'. As long as
the player inputs "y" or "Y" the game continues again and again. If anything else is inputed the
 game says Goodbye and exits.
