2. A simple app that tallys the number of tickets sold and the buyers.

3.tickets, ticketsleft, buyers, num_tickets

4. ticket_sales

5. The ticket_sales() function executes the ticket selling. It initializes the total number of tickets - 'tickets`
and keeps track of the remaining tickets - `ticketsleft` and the total number of buyers - `buyers`.
Inside the while loop, it asks the user for the desired number of tickets - 'num_tickets'.
If the number of tickets is less than 1 or greater than 4 it will display an error message.
If the number of tickets is more than the remaining tickets it will also display an error message.
Otherwise, it takes away the purchased tickets from the remaining tickets and tally's up the total number of buyers.
The loop continues until there are no more tickets remaining (`ticketsleft > 0`).
Lastly, it prints the total number of buyers when all tickets have been sold.
